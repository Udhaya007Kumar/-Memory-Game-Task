# Created a basic HTML layout with a container 
# Create a basic HTML layout with a container for the game board.
# Include a header with the game title and a restart button.
# Implement the game logic to handle card flipping. When a card is clicked, it should flip to reveal the front face.
# Implement a shuffle function to randomize the card positions at the start of the game.
# Track the state of the game (e.g., which cards have been flipped, which pairs have been found).
# Implement the logic to check for matching pairs. If two cards match, they should remain face-up. If they do not match, they should flip back after a short delay.
# Add a restart function that resets the game board and shuffles the cards.
